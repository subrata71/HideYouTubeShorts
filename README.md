## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to my daughter, who inspired me to create this extension. While I was feeding her at my desk, I noticed she preferred watching YouTube Shorts over other entertaining videos. The constant stream of Shorts was quite distracting and made her more restless, causing her to lose focus on her meal. Itâ€™s amusing how well she knows how to navigate using the up and down arrow keys! This experience motivated me to build a solution that enhances the viewing experience for both kids and parents. :D
